      <description>Antinomia was a project created by three students, about a fantasy world.
I joined the team to create the online video game.
At the end of the project, even if it was not released, we had a fully playable online game between two players, with actions like spells, attacks or special abilities from each character.
The game was created using the Unity game engine and entirely programmed in C#.
The data were stored online on the gamesparks platform allowing updates on the server side and multi-device possibility for each player with one account.</description>
