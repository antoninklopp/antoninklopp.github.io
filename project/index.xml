      <description>In this three-person project we created :
 A rendering process using advanced techniques such as :
 Ray-tracing Shadow mapping Alterative rendering (refining render to create a first render faster)
  Animation rendering. We could load a bvh model and use its data to animate a skeleton, rendered by our previously created rendering model.

      <description>In this two-person project, we created different filters for edge finding, denoising and filtering, like : - Gaussian filter - Median filter - Adaptative filters (like bilateral filter)
We used the Laplacian of Gaussian filter to detect edges.
We compared the different performances, accuracy and algorithm speed of each technique, presenting advantages and disadvantages of using them.</description>

      <description>Antinomia was a project created by three students, about a fantasy world.
I joined the team to create the online video game.
At the end of the project, even if it was not released, we had a fully playable online game between two players, with actions like spells, attacks or special abilities from each character.
The game was created using the Unity game engine and entirely programmed in C#.
The data were stored online on the gamesparks platform allowing updates on the server side and multi-device possibility for each player with one account.</description>
